## Yoga Class Tracker

This repository documents an attempt to automate yoga class bookings via Microsoft Teams, store the applicant list in a database, and sync that data into a Notion database.

### Goal

- Accept yoga class registrations through Microsoft Teams.
- Save applicant records into a database.
- Sync that database into a Notion database.

### Approach

Tried three different paths:

- `microsoft-botapp`
- `microsoft-graph`
- `microsoft-power-automate`

### Outcome

All three approaches failed. I decided to move away from Microsoft Teams; the detailed reasons are documented in each folder's README.

### Lessons Learned

This was my first attempt at vibe coding. For a first project, I do not recommend starting on a platform where SSO and security constraints are critical.

### Reflection

I'm proud of the failure. If I can stack this kind of failure 10, 20, 30 times, I expect to learn a lot, and that makes me excited.
